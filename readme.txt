What data can I import from my social media accounts?

    ▪    The social  media API defines what kind of data you can import from your accounts. In general, social media are not very helpful in letting you get access to your own data.  We do our best to find other ways when the API is limited.
    ▪    Linkedin:
    ⁃    Basic API; name, title, image, bio, geo location via the API.
    ⁃    csv-files (your data archive on Linkedin): most of your profile content
    ▪    XING: Most of your profile data
    ▪    Twitter: Name, image, bio, geo location, hashtags
    ▪    Slideshare: Name, title, image, bio, categories
    ▪    Delicious: Name, title, image, bio, categories
